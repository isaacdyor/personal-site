description: My goals for 2025.
---

I am more excited for 2025 than I have been for any year in history. This is the first year of my life where I don't have to work on meaningless work. I can spend every waking moment working on/thinking about really impactful stuff. That feeling is incredibly freeing and it makes me so excited for what I can create this year. In order to make sure this year is as good as I know it can be I am going to lay out some general goals I want to follow.

## Health

I want to be someone who is generally in shape. The two things I want to focus on to achieve this goal are lifting weights and running. My goal is to run and lift weights every non-sunday of the year.

I also want to focus on my diet. This will change throughout the year based on my fitness goals. I just want to generally be concious of what I am eating and try to eat healthy.

I want to really dial in my sleep. I want to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even Sunday. I am also getting an Oura and I want to experiment with what gives me the best sleep.

The final aspect of my health I want to focus on is not consuming any weed or alcohol for the year. Neither of these substances does a lot towards making me a cooler dude, so I will abstain for 2025.

## Personal

I want to make a lot of friends this year. I didn't do a great job of making friends in college for three reasons: I am bad at making friends, I didn't try very hard, I didn't have a lot in common with the people I was around. Solving the second problem will hopefully solve the first one, and now that I am living in San Francisco that solves the third problem. So I want to do my best to put myself out there and meet new interesting people.

I want to go on dates this year. I know that this a little stupid because I just left college where there were thousands of girls my age to move to a city where there are a grand total of 4 girls my age. But either way, I want to get out of my comfort zone in regards to dating and hopefully meet some awesome ladies.

I want to post on social media. Mostly Twitter and Youtube. But I want to start doing things publicly so people know what kind of cool stuff I am working on. One of my buddies from Wordware also said that Twitter is a great way to meet other people in the tech space, so maybe it can even help with my goal to make new friends.

## Professional

My main professional goal of 2025 is to work my ass off. I consider myself a hard worker, but this year I really want to test my limits in terms of how hard I can work. Since I have other goals this year like lifting and making new friends, I cannot spend every waking moment working. So I want to do experiments and figure out how I can maximize my efficiency and output for when I am working. I want to master deep work. (I also still will work some gnarly hours).

I want to build one awesome thing. I want to have something that I built that I am truly proud of by the end of the year. Obviously I will build a lot of stuff over the course of the year but I want to have one thing that I look back and I think this is SO COOL.

I want to explore the world of AI. I have decided that Sunday is the day of Isaac. I am not going to the gym, running, or going to the office on Sunday. I will give myself one day a week to just explore and build whatever I want. Ideally building stuff related to Wordware and writing blogs or filming videos about it. But mostly just making sure it really interests me.

## Conclusion

2025 is going to be the best year of my life to date. I am going to build so much cool stuff and so many awesome relationships. I am going to get in the best shape of my life and become smarter and cooler than I have ever been before. I am going to be a beast.
